pathologic starsector ftl and sunless sea

each character is an ai

most ai are constructs

one character could be a military officer, trying to use his military force to pressure to get his way. he must learn to use charasma
he is brash

one character could be a philanthropist, who tries to use charasma to get his way. he must learn to use force 
he is meek

one character could be an alien (the anthropologist?), who can travel faster than the human ships, and he is trying to rally a support effort to safe humanity

one character could be a cold calculating "true" ai with seemingly non-sensicle answers and and has no  emontional connections
he is the oldest character, he is broken and seems senile because he no longer follows his secondary directives
he has been lied to, to prevent him from being all-knowning, 

npcs
one race has huge ships, but tiny weapons, as a race who does not like war they have no fancy science weapons, so they cannot follow through with their military threats
-one possible option would be to overcharge a fancy weapon (leaving the player with little power in exchange for respect)
